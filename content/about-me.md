I like experimenting more than anything!

Crafting my way through the interwebs of Ethereum and Communities; exploring infrastructure, tooling and relations. Currently working as web3/full stack developer at [Bonfire](https://trybonfire.xyz "") and [Kernel](https://kernel.community/en/ "").

Previously I have worked as a Special Projects Lead at [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co "") and Blockchain Platform Engineer and a Dev Advocate at [Polygon (previously Matic)](https://polygon.technology/ "").

Delivering a talk or explaining a concept to people has always been a very humbling experience for me, a few of my talks on topics surrounding Blockchain are indexed [here](/tags/speaking "").
