I like experimenting more than anything!

Currently working as Special Projects Lead at [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co). Previously I worked as a blockchain developer at [Matic Network](https://matic.network). Delivering a talk or explaining a concept to people has always been a very humbling experience for me, a few of my talks on topics surrounding Blockchain are indexed [here](/tags/speaking).
