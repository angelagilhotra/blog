I was just sooooooper excited with my apple pencil, and this is the first time I've tried [Adobe Fresco](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/fresco.html) (or digital drawing). Made this on my iPad 6th gen with Apple pencil 1st gen. Turns out, you don't necessarily need an ipad pro, just a nice enough photograph ðŸ˜‰

I'm genuinely amazed by how much a tool can shape our abilities and how it's not a one-way relationship of a creator -> creation, but two-way between creator <-> tool and -> creation.
