I heard this poem the first time as the last dialogue of the series - [A Series of Unfortunate Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events_(TV_series)), it touched me then. 

> The night has a thousand eyes
>
> and the day but one;
>
> Yet the light of the bright world dies 
>
> with the dying sun
>
> The mind has a thousand eyes 
>
> and the heart but one;
>
> Yet the light of a whole life dies
>
> when the love is done

\~ Francis William Bourdillon
