Does it ever surprise you

We’re here for the first time

Never have we seen this world before

Never will we see this world again

We’re here for the first time

and probably the only time

We’re this age — for the first time!

Why do we preach?

What makes us believe we know better?

The world is moving, it’s changing

The experience we are having right now

Has never been experienced before

Will not be experienced by anyone ever again

Why do we preach?
